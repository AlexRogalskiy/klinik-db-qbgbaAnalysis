This repo contains the (small) dockerfile that builds the docker container for analyzing some data from the German "Qualitaetsberichte der Kranken-haeuser" obtained from the "Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss" (GBA).

## Standing on the shoulder of giants

The infrastructure part of this project would have been a lot harder if not for the great work of the rocker project which delivers up-to-date R docker container for many purposes and the corresponding building blocks to get something that just works. See here for the project:

https://www.rocker-project.org/

And have a look at specific R-based containers here:

And see here for the great possibility to enhance a specific container with other components like shiny easily:
